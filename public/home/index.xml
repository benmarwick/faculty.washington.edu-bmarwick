      <description>About me I am an Associate Professor of Archaeology. My other local affiliations include the eScience Institute, the Burke Museum, the Center for Statistics and Social Sciences, the Quaternary Research Center, and the Southeast Asia Center.
 My main research activities combine models from evolutionary ecology with analyses of archaeological evidence to investigate past human behaviour. Specific interests include hominin dispersals into mainland Southeast Asia, forager technologies and ecology in Australia, mainland Southeast Asia and elsewhere.</description>

      <description>19 Aug 2019 How to make the data and code for your manuscript available to peer reviewers before making it public. Blog post for Cambridge University Press on the Cambridge Core Blog. It‚Äôs no surprise to any internet user that the way we communicate is rapidly changing. For example, in the distant past, we learned the news of the world by reading a few paragraphs of tiny text in hard copies of newspapers.</description>

      <description>18 Jun 2019 A ‚Äúpetting zoo for code‚Äù makes studies easier to reproduce: A new tool helps users to compose, compute and publish reproducible articles. by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in Nature Index. &amp;ldquo;The result, says Ben Marwick, an archeologist and reproducibility advocate at the University of Washington in Seattle, who has used Code Ocean to publish his computing environments, is like a computational ‚Äúpetting zoo‚Äù &amp;ndash; a platform for making code and data available to the scientific community for interactive exploration, validation and modification.</description>

      <description>Introduction The program here at the University of Washington is primarily a doctoral program in archaeology, with an emphasis in geoarchaeology for those that wish to pursue it. We believe firmly that geoarchaeology is really archaeology using adaptations of techniques and methods. Thus, the geoarchaeologists that come from this department examine archaeological questions by looking at sedimentological, stratigraphical, petrographic (mineralogy and petrology), geomorphological, and pedologic techniques. We are really doing archaeology, with a geological orientation.</description>
