18 Jun 2019 **A “petting zoo for code” makes studies easier to reproduce: A new tool helps users to compose, compute and publish reproducible articles.** by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in [_Nature Index_](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/a-petting-zoo-for-code-makes-studies-easier-to-reproduce). "The result, says Ben Marwick, an archeologist and reproducibility advocate at the University of Washington in Seattle, who has used Code Ocean to publish his computing environments, is like a computational “petting zoo” -- a platform for making code and data available to the scientific community for interactive exploration, validation and modification."

25 May 2019. **OPP Interviews: Jade d’Alpoim Guedes and Ben Marwick**, by Emerson Del Ponte and Adam Sparks for the [Open Plant Pathology (OPP) Blog](https://openplantpathology.org/post/2019-05-25-interview-jade-ben/). "My awareness of the importance of doing reproducible research came pretty late – well after I’d finished my PhD and started working as a professor. I needed some time to acquire the necessary basic skills, and to build up the courage to work differently from my peers and senior colleagues, and to be able to tell them that there might be better ways to do research. Most of my reproducible practices are self-taught by adopting practices I’ve observed in elsewhere, such as ecology and biology."

5 Mar 2019 **EP015 Reproducible Research in Archaeology with rrtools** Podcast interview by David Brassard and Patrick Diehl for [Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) for Science](https://flossforscience.com/podcast/season-2-episode-3) "For episode 15, we interview the Associate Professor of Archaeology Ben Marwick. We start our discussion with an overview of some FLOSS tools he uses and how much FLOSS are used in archaeology. He shares with us his experience in regard to working completely in the open with GitHub and his hope that open science will become the norm in the future. We also discuss about rrtools and his propositions on how to greatly improve the reproducibility of science. As a closing though he shares with us his arguments why early career researchers should invest time to learn and transition to FLOSS tools."

22 Aug 2018 **A toolkit for data transparency takes shape: A simple software toolset can help to ease the pain of reproducing computational analyses.** by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05990-5) 560, 513-515. "Marwick says '...tantalizing connections lie abandoned because they’re impossible to explore. It’s like we’re a roomful of hungry people handing around tins of canned food, and nobody has a can opener. And then we’re asking each other, why doesn’t anyone eat anything?'"

26 Oct 2018 **The oldest weapons in North America offer a new view of prehistoric tech** by By Neel V. Patel for [Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/oldest-weapons-north-america-spear-points/). “I think they’ve done an amazing job in dating the deposits in the artifacts” and providing a “secure chronology,” says Ben Marwick, an archeologist based at the University of Washington who was not involved with the study. “They’ve invested a lot of effort and it’s paid off very well, and I really think that’s a strength of the study.” That being said, Marwick also points out the findings have their limits. “The critical artifacts [the authors] based their findings on are small in number. It leaves an unanswered question of whether this is a real pattern of an early technology we don’t know much about, or if it’s just a one-off sort of thing, and maybe there’s just a small number of people deciding to make these sorts of artifacts one afternoon.”  Marwick also notes there’s not a very robust description of the actual clay deposits in the paper, and that pictures seemed to show some vertical cracks in the layers. “It looks like there might be some potential for some of these artifacts to move through the cracks. It’s possible some of the artifacts might have moved down,” and are not as old as we might really believe. Marwick has conducted work in similar archeological sites in Australia, where he and his team have had to anticipate those sorts of possibilities and account for them through microscopic analysis and other testing. “My sense is that that work hasn’t been done here, and I’d look forward to seeing some of that before I get too excited about some of the claims.” Lastly, while Marwick says it’s possible the points originate from a separate group of migrants, he’s hesitant to put too much stock in that interpretation. “We know that one group can make many different kinds of artifacts. It’s not always really the case that different kinds of artifacts mean different kinds of cultural groups.” There are only a handful of sites within North America that scientists are able to work with, so it’s difficult to come up with conclusions that will apply wholesale to the history of early human migrants in North America. He’s hopeful more research can prove whether or not these kinds of findings are part of a pattern or just a kind of random peculiarity in the field of anthropology. Nevertheless, Marwick is encouraged by the overall implication of the findings that early technologies in the Americas are more diverse than we previously thought. “It’s a very important part of this new paper,” he says. 

6 Sept 2018 **Open framework tackles backwards science.** by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in [_Nature Index_](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/open-framework-tackles-backwards-science). "Marwick says [the] ability to integrate multiple online systems is one of the "strong attractions" of the OSF. Another, he says, is its integrated preprint server. OSF preprints can be associated with projects, providing an easy way to migrate back and forth between a project's data and the resulting manuscripts."

9 Apr 2018 **A finger bone from an unexpected place and time upends the story of human migration out of Africa** by Karen Kaplan in the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-human-finger-fossil-20180409-story.html) “What makes the Al Wusta find especially important is that it is a direct date on a bone,” [Ben] said. “Most of the other evidence that support this pre-65,000 year idea have not been able to directly date human bones.” However, he said, he wished that the authors had been more open about sharing their raw data and methods, to allow other members of the archaeological and anthropological community to verify their discovery. “It would be ideal to see some independent validation of the ages by another lab, unrelated to these authors, dating samples from the bone,” Marwick said. “That would help to confirm that the result is reproducible, which is the cornerstone of any scientific claim.”

26 Oct 2017 **How I Work Open: Ben Marwick** by Liz Bedford, a blog post for the [Scholarly Communication & Publishing Department at the University of Washington Libraries](https://blogs.uw.edu/openpub/2017/10/26/how-i-work-open-ben-marwick/) "While part of my archaeology work consists of traditional activities like excavation, fieldwork, and surveying, another is part is computer-based. Much of my effort is focused on making the computational work done in the lab open and transparent, because in the field what we’re doing is automatically open."

23 Mar 2017 **Open Science w/ Ben Marwick - Episode 49** Podcast interview by Chris Webster and Christopher Sims for [ArchaeoTech](https://www.archaeologypodcastnetwork.com/archaeotech/49) "Dr. Ben Marwick returns to talk about the Open Science Interest Group, his recent publication on technology and open archaeology, and his workshop at the SAA Annual Meeting in Vancouver."

17 Nov 2016 **Ben Marwick and Coding at SAA2017 - Episode 40** Podcast interview by Chris Webster and Christopher Sims for [ArchaeoTech](https://www.archaeologypodcastnetwork.com/archaeotech/40) "On today's episode we talk to Ben Marwick. Ben has started a forum and a workshop for the 2017 Society for American Archaeology meetings in Vancouver, Canada. We talk about coding and what they're going to do at the forum and the workshop. It's a new kind of session and we're excited to help announce it."

16 April 2016 **Journal buoys code-review push** by Erika Check Hayden, published in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/1.17323!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/520276a.pdf?origin=ppub) 520, 276-277."Another is social: there is no etiquette governing how those who wish to replicate results should behave towards those whose work they examine. If authors of erroneous studies face public embarrassment and shaming, that can discourage other researchers from submitting to the same scrutiny. “It’s like taking your clothes off; you don’t want to be embarrassed by someone pointing at you because you have a lot of body hair,” says Ben Marwick,"

17 April 2010 **Australian Archaeology and Rabbit Warrens** Podcast interview by Diana O'Carroll and Duncan Howitt-Marshall for [Naked Archaeology](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/podcasts/archive/naked-archaeology/australian-archaeology-and-rabbit-warrens). "This month on Naked Archaeology: when and how did the first humans make it to Australia? We unearth the evidence from archaeology and genetics. Also this month we discover that Neanderthals could be relations of ours, after all. Plus, in Back Yard Archaeology Diana ventures into her own back yard to find out what was so special about rabbit warrens"
