18 Jun 2019 **A “petting zoo for code” makes studies easier to reproduce: A new tool helps users to compose, compute and publish reproducible articles.** by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in [_Nature Index_](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/a-petting-zoo-for-code-makes-studies-easier-to-reproduce). "The result, says Ben Marwick, an archeologist and reproducibility advocate at the University of Washington in Seattle, who has used Code Ocean to publish his computing environments, is like a computational “petting zoo” -- a platform for making code and data available to the scientific community for interactive exploration, validation and modification."

25 May 2019. **OPP Interviews: Jade d’Alpoim Guedes and Ben Marwick**, by Emerson Del Ponte and Adam Sparks for the [Open Plant Pathology (OPP) Blog](https://openplantpathology.org/post/2019-05-25-interview-jade-ben/). "My awareness of the importance of doing reproducible research came pretty late – well after I’d finished my PhD and started working as a professor. I needed some time to acquire the necessary basic skills, and to build up the courage to work differently from my peers and senior colleagues, and to be able to tell them that there might be better ways to do research. Most of my reproducible practices are self-taught by adopting practices I’ve observed in elsewhere, such as ecology and biology."

22 Aug 2018 **A toolkit for data transparency takes shape: A simple software toolset can help to ease the pain of reproducing computational analyses.** by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05990-5) 560, 513-515. "Marwick says '...tantalizing connections lie abandoned because they’re impossible to explore. It’s like we’re a roomful of hungry people handing around tins of canned food, and nobody has a can opener. And then we’re asking each other, why doesn’t anyone eat anything?'"

6 Sept 2018 **Open framework tackles backwards science.** by Jeffrey M. Perkel, published in [_Nature Index_](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/open-framework-tackles-backwards-science). "Marwick says [the] ability to integrate multiple online systems is one of the "strong attractions" of the OSF. Another, he says, is its integrated preprint server. OSF preprints can be associated with projects, providing an easy way to migrate back and forth between a project's data and the resulting manuscripts."

26 Oct 2017 **How I Work Open: Ben Marwick** by Liz Bedford, a blog post for the [Scholarly Communication & Publishing Department at the University of Washington Libraries](https://blogs.uw.edu/openpub/2017/10/26/how-i-work-open-ben-marwick/) "While part of my archaeology work consists of traditional activities like excavation, fieldwork, and surveying, another is part is computer-based. Much of my effort is focused on making the computational work done in the lab open and transparent, because in the field what we’re doing is automatically open."

16 April 2016 **Journal buoys code-review push** by Erika Check Hayden, published in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/1.17323!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/520276a.pdf?origin=ppub) 520, 276-277."Another is social: there is no etiquette governing how those who wish to replicate results should behave towards those whose work they examine. If authors of erroneous studies face public embarrassment and shaming, that can discourage other researchers from submitting to the same scrutiny. “It’s like taking your clothes off; you don’t want to be embarrassed by someone pointing at you because you have a lot of body hair,” says Ben Marwick,"
