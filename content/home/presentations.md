7 Dec 2023 **[SEAMEO SPAFA's "Archaeology Ethics in Southeast Asia" series](https://www.seameo-spafa.org/)** [Session I: Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ShSZrwAvjs) (2:35:21) The inaugural session of SEAMEO SPAFA's "Archaeology Ethics in Southeast Asia" series took place on Zoom and SPAFA's Facebook Live on 7 December 2023 at 10:00 am (GMT+7). During the opening session, attendees met the resource persons specializing in ethical matters within Southeast Asian archaeology and got an overview of the series (four online and one onsite during SPAFACON 2024). Questions were then gathered from the audience and posed to the speakers at the end. The "Archaeology Ethics in Southeast Asia" series will cover issues of gender and sex discrimination (including harassment), accessibility and inclusivity of the discipline (including but not limited to ableism and ageism), as well as intellectual property. I was invited to give a brief presentation in this session. 

13 Sept 2021 **[PEMSEA Panel 6: The Future Southeast Asian Archaeology in the U.S.](https://www.facebook.com/museodeisarog.psu/videos/396716412049347/?notif_id=1631584890332215)** (2:01:26) This panel discussion was part of a series hosted by the [Program on Early Modern Southeast Asia](https://earlymodernseasia.org/event/panel-6-the-future-of-southeast-asian-archaeology-in-the-us/). Abstract: Southeast Asian archaeology programs are underrepresented in the US higher education system. Although SE Asian groups now comprise one of the largest immigrant groups in the country, only five institutions have a distinctly Southeast Asian archaeology program. In this panel, we bring together early- and mid-career US-based archaeologists to discuss ways to strengthen SE Asian archaeology and to help address issues of access, gender disparity, and representation. The panelists will also talk about how their respective research in SE Asia facilitate the inclusion of SE Asian archaeological observations to archaeological theory and method.

18 Feb 2021 **[Galisonian Logic Devices as Affordances for Decolonizing Archaeology](https://youtu.be/iqJzhOZ7Auo)** (1:10:09) This presentation was given on 18 February 2021 as part of the [Garrod Research seminar series of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/events/garrod-research-seminars/galisonian-logic-devices-affordances-decolonizing-archaeology). Abstract: An enduring legacy of colonial logics in archaeology is the collection and hoarding of archaeological objects and data. Many museums are working to return objects to their traditional owners, and many countries have legislation to support this. While norms of object repatriation are becoming increasingly widespread and concrete, we are still far from a consensus about how to address colonial practices in sharing archaeological data and methods. Many archaeologists hoard and refuse to share data, for bad reasons, and free from consequences. I describe how the use of Galisonian logic devices in archaeology provides an opening to adjust behaviours about data sharing. I analyse bibliometric data to show what devices are currently showing the most productivity as affordances to decolonize attitudes about data and method sharing. I review best practices on navigating options for making data and methods available, recognising that not all data is fit for openness, and that often archaeologists donâ€™t have enough information to be the sole decision-maker about data and method availability.

25 Sept 2020 **[Tool-Driven Revolutions in Archaeological Science: Open Source and Open Science as Transcendental Tools](https://youtu.be/VKVlcMCLm04)** (1:14:11) A presentation invited by the Archaeology Information Interest Group of the Archaeology Centre, University of Toronto.  Abstract: "There is an argument in philosophy of science that revolutions in science are either idea-driven or tool-driven. We explore this debate in light of recent efforts by many scientific disciplines to embrace methods to improve the reproducibility of their research. One of the most profound changes driven by this concern for reproducibility and transparency is from analysing data using tools dependent on point-and-clicking with a mouse in closed source software, to tools based on writing scripts in open source programming languages and making them openly available. We present bibliometric evidence for this change in ecology and in archaeology to test if the adoption of these new tools is revolutionary or transformational. We identify a positive citation effect for papers that use the open source programming language R. We discuss how computational approaches to improving reproducibility and transparency in archaeology are mediated and transformed by the use of R code. We review the transcendental aspects of how adoption of these tools are applicable to a wide range of varying methods, materials, settings or research interests in archaeological science."
