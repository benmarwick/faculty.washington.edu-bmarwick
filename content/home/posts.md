19 Aug 2019 **How to make the data and code for your manuscript available to peer reviewers before making it public.** Blog post for Cambridge University Press on the [Cambridge Core Blog](https://www.cambridge.org/core/blog/2019/08/19/how-to-make-the-data-and-code-for-your-manuscript-available-to-peer-reviewers-before-making-it-public/). It’s no surprise to any internet user that the way we communicate is rapidly changing. For example, in the distant past, we learned the news of the world by reading a few paragraphs of tiny text in hard copies of newspapers. For especially newsworthy events we got a black and white photo or two. Nowadays, we are accustomed to news websites that transmit distant events to us with full color video, images, infographics, and a stream of live tweets. Just as news broadcasting is changing, so has scholarly communication.

30 Jul 2018 **How researchers can solve the bottle-opener problem with compute capsules.** Blog post for Cambridge University Press on the [Cambridge Core Blog](https://www.cambridge.org/core/blog/2018/07/30/how-researchers-can-solve-the-bottle-opener-problem-with-compute-capsules/) with Suzanne E. Pilaar Birch. Imagine a group of people playing a sport together on a hot day. Although it’s a friendly match, they play vigorously and at the end of their game they’re hot and thirsty. A few people in the group brought a cooler filled with ice and a variety of bottled beverages (among them our favourite, a tangy non-alcoholic ginger beer). They pass out the bottles and everyone is looking forward to a refreshing cool drink and trying the different flavours. But, disaster! No-one has a bottle-opener!  

19 Nov 2018 **New dates for ancient stone tools in China point to local invention of complex technology.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/new-dates-for-ancient-stone-tools-in-china-point-to-local-invention-of-complex-technology-106914) with Bo Li and Hu Yue. A fresh look at museum artifacts fills in a gap in the Asian archaeological record and refutes the idea that an advanced technique was imported from the West by early modern humans.

9 Aug 2017 **Landscape archaeology and reproducible research at the 2017 Berlin Summer School.** Blog post for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-08-09-landscape-archaeology-and-reproducible-research-2017-berlin-summer-school). Recently we concluded the 2017 Summer School on Reproducible Research in Landscape Archaeology at the Freie Universität Berlin (17th–21th July), funded and jointly organised by Exc264 Topoi, CRC1266, and ISAAKiel. With a group of 15 archaeologists and geographers from Berlin, Kiel and Cologne, we spent a week learning advanced geostatistics and how to make our research more reproducible.

19 Jul 2017 **Here’s the three-pronged approach we’re using in our own research to tackle the reproducibility issue.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/heres-the-three-pronged-approach-were-using-in-our-own-research-to-tackle-the-reproducibility-issue-80997) with Zenobia Jacobs. A team of archaeologists strived to improve the reproducibility of their results, influencing their choices in the field, in the lab and during data analysis.

19 Jul 2017 **Buried tools and pigments tell a new history of humans in Australia for 65,000 years.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/buried-tools-and-pigments-tell-a-new-history-of-humans-in-australia-for-65-000-years-81021) with Chris Clarkson, Lynley Wallis, Richard Fullagar, and Zenobia Jacobs. A new study pushes back the first known evidence of human activity in Australia – to 65,000 years ago.

9 Nov 2015 **How computers broke science – and what we can do to fix it.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/how-computers-broke-science-and-what-we-can-do-to-fix-it-49938). Virtually every researcher relies on computers to collect or analyze data. But when computers are opaque black boxes that manipulate data, it's impossible to replicate studies – a core value for science.

24 Apr 2015 **Archaeology with open-source software. It's getting easier.** Blog post for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-26-archaeology-open-source-software-its-getting-easier). This short post is written for archaeologists who frequently perform common data analysis and visualisation tasks in Excel, SPSS or similar commercial packages.

10 Mar 2015 **Teaching in Yangon.** Blog post for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/03/teaching-in-yangon.html). On Sat 7 March I spent a full day teaching a Software Carpentry workshop at the University of Yangon with 23 archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology. The workshop is part of a training component of an archaeological research project funded by the Australian Research Council, the University of Washington and the University of Wollongong.
