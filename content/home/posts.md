21 Nov 2022 **Three levels of reproducible workflow remove barriers for archaeologists and increase accessibility**  My recommendation posted to [PCI Archaeology](https://archaeo.peercommunityin.org/PCIArchaeology/articles/rec?id=239) based on reviews by Sam Leggett, Cyler Conrad, Cheng Liu and Lisa Lodwick of '[Removing Barriers to Reproducible Research in Archaeology](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7320029)' by Emma Karoune and Esther Plomp 

28 Feb 2021 **A database of lapidary artifacts in the Caribbean for the Ceramic Age** My recommendation posted to [PCI Archaeology](https://archaeo.peercommunityin.org/PCIArchaeology/articles/rec?id=90) based on reviews by Clarissa Belardelli, Stefano Costa, Robert Bischoff and Li-Ying Wang of '[A database of lapidary artifacts in the Caribbean for the Ceramic Age](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7dq3b/)' by Alain Queffelec, Pierrick Fouéré, Jean-Baptiste Caverne  

19 May 2020 **When Field or Lab Work is not an Option - Leveraging Open Data Resources for Remote Research** [_rOpenSci Blog_](https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/05/19/covid-19-open-data/) with The rOpenSci Team, Brooke Anderson, Robin Lovelace, Ben Marwick, Ben Raymond, Anton Van de Putte, Louise Slater, Sam Zipper, Ilaria Prosdocimi, Sam Albers, and Claudia Vitolo. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted all of our lives in a very short period of time. Spring and summer are usually very busy as students prepare to go the field to engage in various data collection efforts. The pandemic has also disrupted these carefully planned activities as travel is suspended and local and remote field stations have closed indefinitely. A lost field season can be a major setback for a dissertation timeline and students will have to improvise. One promising opportunity to continue research efforts during these unprecedented times is taking advantage of the massive amounts of open scientific data that are freely available. Open data can form the basis of a review, synthesis, or new research. Inspired by tweets from Ethan White about "PhD research from a distance", the rOpenSci team did an in-depth exploration of how we provide access to open data. Our goal is to inspire students to find research opportunities with open data and highlight some of the rOpenSci packages that already make programmatic access possible. We also highlight some examples of how specific collections of packages are being used right now in fields as varied as archaeology and climate science.

29 Aug 2019 **Surveying archaeologists across the globe reveals deeper and more widespread roots of the human age, the Anthropocene** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/surveying-archaeologists-across-the-globe-reveals-deeper-and-more-widespread-roots-of-the-human-age-the-anthropocene-122008) with Erle C. Ellis, Lucas Stephens, and Nicole Boivin. Think the anthropocene age started with plastics or nuclear testing? Think again. Surveying archaeologists around the globe underscores for how long and how widely people have been changing Earth. 

19 Aug 2019 **How to make the data and code for your manuscript available to peer reviewers before making it public.** Blog post for Cambridge University Press on the [Cambridge Core Blog](https://www.cambridge.org/core/blog/2019/08/19/how-to-make-the-data-and-code-for-your-manuscript-available-to-peer-reviewers-before-making-it-public/). It’s no surprise to any internet user that the way we communicate is rapidly changing. For example, in the distant past, we learned the news of the world by reading a few paragraphs of tiny text in hard copies of newspapers. For especially newsworthy events we got a black and white photo or two. Nowadays, we are accustomed to news websites that transmit distant events to us with full color video, images, infographics, and a stream of live tweets. Just as news broadcasting is changing, so has scholarly communication.

30 Jul 2018 **How researchers can solve the bottle-opener problem with compute capsules.** Blog post for Cambridge University Press on the [Cambridge Core Blog](https://www.cambridge.org/core/blog/2018/07/30/how-researchers-can-solve-the-bottle-opener-problem-with-compute-capsules/) with Suzanne E. Pilaar Birch. Imagine a group of people playing a sport together on a hot day. Although it’s a friendly match, they play vigorously and at the end of their game they’re hot and thirsty. A few people in the group brought a cooler filled with ice and a variety of bottled beverages (among them our favourite, a tangy non-alcoholic ginger beer). They pass out the bottles and everyone is looking forward to a refreshing cool drink and trying the different flavours. But, disaster! No-one has a bottle-opener!  

19 Nov 2018 **New dates for ancient stone tools in China point to local invention of complex technology.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/new-dates-for-ancient-stone-tools-in-china-point-to-local-invention-of-complex-technology-106914) with Bo Li and Hu Yue. A fresh look at museum artifacts fills in a gap in the Asian archaeological record and refutes the idea that an advanced technique was imported from the West by early modern humans.

9 Aug 2017 **Landscape archaeology and reproducible research at the 2017 Berlin Summer School.** Blog post for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-08-09-landscape-archaeology-and-reproducible-research-2017-berlin-summer-school). Recently we concluded the 2017 Summer School on Reproducible Research in Landscape Archaeology at the Freie Universität Berlin (17th–21th July), funded and jointly organised by Exc264 Topoi, CRC1266, and ISAAKiel. With a group of 15 archaeologists and geographers from Berlin, Kiel and Cologne, we spent a week learning advanced geostatistics and how to make our research more reproducible.

19 Jul 2017 **Here’s the three-pronged approach we’re using in our own research to tackle the reproducibility issue.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/heres-the-three-pronged-approach-were-using-in-our-own-research-to-tackle-the-reproducibility-issue-80997) with Zenobia Jacobs. A team of archaeologists strived to improve the reproducibility of their results, influencing their choices in the field, in the lab and during data analysis.

19 Jul 2017 **Buried tools and pigments tell a new history of humans in Australia for 65,000 years.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/buried-tools-and-pigments-tell-a-new-history-of-humans-in-australia-for-65-000-years-81021) with Chris Clarkson, Lynley Wallis, Richard Fullagar, and Zenobia Jacobs. A new study pushes back the first known evidence of human activity in Australia – to 65,000 years ago.

9 Nov 2015 **How computers broke science – and what we can do to fix it.** [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/how-computers-broke-science-and-what-we-can-do-to-fix-it-49938). Virtually every researcher relies on computers to collect or analyze data. But when computers are opaque black boxes that manipulate data, it's impossible to replicate studies – a core value for science.

24 Apr 2015 **Archaeology with open-source software. It's getting easier.** Blog post for the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-09-26-archaeology-open-source-software-its-getting-easier). This short post is written for archaeologists who frequently perform common data analysis and visualisation tasks in Excel, SPSS or similar commercial packages.

10 Mar 2015 **Teaching in Yangon.** Blog post for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/03/teaching-in-yangon.html). On Sat 7 March I spent a full day teaching a Software Carpentry workshop at the University of Yangon with 23 archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology. The workshop is part of a training component of an archaeological research project funded by the Australian Research Council, the University of Washington and the University of Wollongong.
