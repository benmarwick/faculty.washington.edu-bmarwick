In addition to teaching these classes I am also the coordinator of the [Archaeological Sciences Option](https://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/undergrad/tracks-options/archaeological-science). This is a transcripted sequence of classes recommended to students who are interested in an in-depth study archaeological methods and theories.

### ARCHY 208 Introduction to Archaeological Data Science
Pyramids, Stonehenge, Nazi Death Camps: Pseudo-archaeology makes radical claims about such sites, but what do the data reveal? Tackles false claims about the human past using archaeological data. Hands-on experience of data analysis and visualization using the software program R in computing laboratories. NSc. Archaeological Sciences non-core class, and ideal preparation for ARCHY 482 & 486 Geoarchaeology

### ARCHY 299 Archaeological Laboratory Techniques 
Laboratory procedures geared to one specific archaeological research project. 1-3, max. 12 credits, SSc

### ARCHY 309 Archaeology of Mainland Southeast Asia
Covers the archaeology of mainland Southeast Asia from the first colonization by hominins to the appearance of written texts, especially in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar.

### ARCHY 319 Archaeology of Australia
Archaeology of Australia with an emphasis on understanding of the evidence and interpretation of both singular events and long-term processes in prehistory. Prerequisite: ARCHY 205. 5 credits, SSc. Archaeological Sciences non-core class.

### ARCHY 483 & 488 Lithic Technology Lab & Seminar
Current approaches to analysis of lithic technology, including types of information obtainable (technological, functional, social, ideological) and constraints affecting the formation and analysis of lithic assemblages. Lectures and seminars surveying recent research and debates. 3 & 5 credits. NSc & RSN. Archaeological Sciences core class. Strongly recommended to take ARCHY 208 as preparation. 

### ARCHY 482 & 486 Geoarchaeology Lab & Seminar
Lab & seminar on the identification, analysis, and interpretation of sediments and soils associated with archaeological remains. Covers geomorphology, geochemistry and geophysics in archaeology. NSc. Archaeological Sciences core class. Strongly recommended to take ARCHY 208 as preparation.

### ARCHY 499 Undergraduate Research 
Advanced laboratory procedures geared to one specific archaeological research project. 5-6, max. 12 credits.
