This document is primarily aimed at graduate students pursuing a PhD or masters degree. Some sections are also relevant to undergraduates, please ask if you have questions about what parts are appropriate to you.

## Purpose

This document should be viewed as a tool to initiate discussion during the early stages of the graduate program, with an awareness that the relationship and expectations will evolve with time. The parties may wish to use this template not only for verbal discussion but also as a written letter of understanding that will help to guide the relationship and expectations of the student, their PI, and the relevant departments/faculties. The hope is that this agreement clarifies questions that arise in the lab setting and reduces conflict or tension to make everyone’s interactions more enjoyable.  

## The code

The UW Geoarchaeology Laboratory and Ben Marwick's Field Research Projects are committed to a harassment-free policy

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every member has an enjoyable and fulfilling learning and working experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates is expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants at all times.

To make clear what is expected, all participants (including myself) must conform to the following Code of Conduct:

Ben Marwick, as head of the UW Geoarchaeology Laboratory and director of field research projects, and participants, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, gender, gender identity and expression, national origin, physical appearance, religion, relationship status, or sexual orientation. Harassment includes offensive comments related to age, body size, deliberate intimidation, disability, gender, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, race, religion, relationship status, or sexual orientation. Harassment also includes unwanted following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, stalking, sexual images in public spaces, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.

**In summary:**  

- All communication – online and in person – should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.  
- Be kind and respectful to others and their opinions.  
- Behave professionally.  
- Do not insult or put down other lab members. Your ideas are not more valuable than others'.
- Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes will not be tolerated in this space.
- Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.    

Participants asked to stop any harassing or disrespectful behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Participants who violate these rules – no matter how much they have contributed to the UW Geoarchaeology Laboratory or field research projects, or how specialized their skill set – will need to meet with Ben and/or other faculty and staff. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Ben, the perpetuator will be asked to discontinue their participation.

To report violation, you can do any of the following:

- Please feel free to talk to me or other UW faculty person.   
- Report to the the [Chair of the Anthropology Department](https://anthropology.washington.edu/contact) or the [University of Washington ombud office](https://www.washington.edu/ombud/).   
- Make an anonymous report and get advice from the [UW SafeCampus Office](http://www.washington.edu/safecampus/)
