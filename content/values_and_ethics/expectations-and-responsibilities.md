## Big Picture

Science is hard. But it’s also fun. In the Geoarchaeology Lab and during Field Research, we want to make sure that everyone experiences a positive, engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding environment. To maintain that environment, we all have to do a few things.

-	Work on what you’re passionate about, work hard at it, and be proud of it. Be so proud of it that you have to suppress bragging (but it’s ok to brag sometimes).
-	Scientists have to be rigorous and careful. Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. It’s ok to makes mistakes, but mistakes shouldn’t be because of carelessness or rushed work. Don't hesitate to seek new information, and update your plans accordingly.
-	If you do make a mistake, you should definitely tell your collaborators (if they have already seen the results, and especially if the paper is being written up, is already submitted, or already accepted). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
-	We all want to get papers published and do great things. But we do this honestly and with integrity. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding out the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important.
- Support your peers and colleagues in our lab and during field research. Help them out if they need help (even if you aren’t on the project), and let them vent when they need to. Science is collaborative, not competitive. Help others, and you can expect others to help you when you need it. Nurture those who are junior to you.
- Respect your peers and colleagues. Respect their strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it, and for support and a kind ear when they need that. Respect their culture, their religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation.
- Communicate honestly, even when it’s difficult. Avoid [harmful communication](http://www.shakesville.com/2011/12/harmful-communication-part-one-intent.html). Practice good listening and recognize that [your good intentions do not inoculate you from wrongdoing](https://softloud.github.io/codingofkindness/)
-	If you’re struggling, tell someone (feel free to tell Ben!). Your health and happiness come first. The lab and field research groups look out for the well-being of all its members. We are here to help. It’s ok to go through hard patches (we all do), but you shouldn’t feel shy about asking for help or just venting.
-	If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. We can’t thrive in an environment we aren’t comfortable in, and disrespect or rudeness will not be tolerated in the lab. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Ben. In any case, tell Ben.
-	If you have a problem with Ben and are comfortable telling him about it, do! If you aren’t comfortable, then tell another member of the Anthropology Department, such as the chair. If you can't tell the chair, contact the [University of Washington ombud office](https://www.washington.edu/ombud/).
- Stay up to date on the latest research, by subscribing to email alerts for journal table of contents. Also consider following archaeologists and scientists in related fields on Twitter
- We like to do good science and have fun. At the same time, but also separately. Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and don’t ever feel bad for taking time off work.

## Small Picture

There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to keep lab and field research running smoothly.

- If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick. If you’re sick, reschedule your meetings and participants for the day (or the next couple of days) as soon as you can.
- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).
- Show up to your meetings, show up to your classes, and show up to lab meetings. You do not have to be in at 9am every day – just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.
- Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you’re the last one leaving for the day.
- Keep the lab and field research areas tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
- Dress code is casual (and you can dress up if you want!) but not too casual. Ensure you have appropriate personal protective equipment, minimally long pants, enclosed shoes, a lab coat and safety classes.
- Be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.
